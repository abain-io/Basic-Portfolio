                        <p>Throughout my 20+ year (SaaS) sales career, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to
                            negotiate and develop strategic business partnerships and successfully contribute to several
                            notable teams and global enterprises (including LinkedIn)!</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>I recently decided to dive in and go for it (and learn how to code)! Thankfully, I was accepted into
                            the Full-Stack Web Development Program at UT Austin, and am pursuing my passion for web development
                            and coding. I am currently immersed in Front-end development coursework that includes: HTML5
                            • CSS3 • JavaScript • and jQuery.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>I have a relentless devotion to continuously progress as a developer, and enjoy helping people solve
                            meaningful real-world problems with data-driven results.</p>

                        <br>
